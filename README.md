## Win98 \- password


</div>

### Description

Hi, I wrote a simple program which obtains user's password. Yes, his main password, no cached passwords. Your OS must be Windows98 (SE) because this version has a small "bug" which I exploit -> when user login, Windows save his password to memory...... Don't believe? Just have a look at this simple "hack".
